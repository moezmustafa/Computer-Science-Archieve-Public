# Build Cross Platform React Native Apps with Exponent and Redux

## Get Started
### Why Use React Native?
- Friendly workflow out-of-the-box
- Massive community
- Code reuse

### This Is What We'll Build
- A to-do app
- The UI renders differently for iOS and Android
- Achieves component reuse across platforms, with platform-specific rendering

### React Native Overview
- React Native does not wrap HTML, it uses 100% native views
- JSX -> (compiles to) JS -> (JS loaded and calls render()) JSCore -> (render native components) Obj-C / Java

### React Overview
- Using class components
- must define `render()` function returning a single root JSX element
- components can be used within other components

### Versions and Conventions
- package.json file made available to create project with dependencies used in this course
- stateless functional components not used in this course
- uses React Native 0.19.1, Xcode 7.2.1

### Configure Atom with ESLint
- use eslint in text editor and build systems
- uses eslint with airbnb JS styleguide
- packages used `babel-eslint`, `eslint`, `eslint-config-airbnb`, `eslint-plugin-react`
- `.eslintrc` eslint configuration (available from course resources)
