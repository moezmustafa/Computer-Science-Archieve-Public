## React Native
PROS:
- easy to learn
- lots of resources
- lots of libraries
- reusable components
- hot reloading

CONS:
- JS is not type safe without additional tools
- there are a lot of flavours
- performance
- bridging can be challenging
- debugging (red screen of death)

## Flutter
PROS:
- type safe (dart)
- supported by Google
- reusable components
- fast layout engine
- hot reloading

CONS:
- young platform
- not a lot of resources
- need to bridge to native
- not a lot of devs with experience


## Native
PROS:
- performance
- native feel
- support
- community support
- quickly add new OS features

CONS:
- code sharing across platforms
- steep learning curve
- expensive (two devs/teams)

## How To Decide
- Write down goals (performance, speed of development, native feel, code sharing etc.)
- Research (talk to other dev that have used each platform, read articles, research opinions from both sides (don't base your decision on the opinions; however opinions help us understand other devs experiences))
- Prototype and measure
- Separate fact from opinion
- Write down the results (score each prototype against goals - identifies the best solution at the moment (may change in future!))
