# A Mind For Numbers - Barbara Oakley

- chunk low-level routines to solve a particular problem type
- 7-steps to effective chunking (**list here...**)
  1. Get a problem with an available written solution
  2. Complete the problem, only referring to the written solution as a last resort for steps where required
  3. Complete the problem again, focusing on the key concepts and steps
  4. Sleep on it (diffused mode), complete the problem one more before sleeping on it
  5. ?
  6. Complete a second problem to solidy understanding
  7. Mentally work through the problem in different environments (car, train, gym etc.)
- interleve learning to avoid over-learning
- practice different types of problems to practice identify when to use a particular chunk
- hazy thinking, re-reading sentences multiple times - try a few press-ups or other light exercise to regain a focused mind
