## What Is Haskell?
- A pure functional, lazy, statically-typed language
- Pure functional
  - functions are a value type (1st class language citizen)
  - all values are immutable
- Lazy
  - values are only evaluated if/when they are used
- Statically typed
  - provides the benefits of a statically typed language but provides features to make working with static types simpler
  
## Why Should I Learn Haskell?
- Strong mathematical and theoretical foundation
- Performance comparable to Java/C#
- Comprehensive libraries now available for business development work

## History
- Many lazy functional languages developed in 1980s
- 1987 - Haskell standard committee formed (to combine efforts and form a single lazy functional language)
- 1990 - Haskell 1.0 (not very practical, mostly used for research)
- 1997 - Haskell 98 (add features to make Haskell practical and usable as a general programming langauge)
- 2009 - Haskell 2010 (core extensions added)

- Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) - de-facto compiler
